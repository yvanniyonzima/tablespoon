# Tablespoon
My friend and I had an idea of making an application for recipes lovers where they can keep track of all their favorite ingredients. With a lot of recipe websites an application out there, we were looking for something we could add to make it different and unique. That is when Tablespoon was born. 

### RECIPE MANIPULATION

Just like any other recipe website or application, this applicatin will let the user add, remove and edit their recipes however they want to. The user willl have the option ot add the recipe either manually or by sesarching for the name of the recipe. If the user chooses to search for the recipe, they will be presented with optional recipes that will be acquired using a Spoonacular API, and then the user can choose which one they would like to add to their list. 


### KEEPING TRACK OF INGREDIENTS

The app will feature a "My Fridge" page where the user can keep track of the ingredients in their pantry, and a "Shopping Cart" page where the user can make a grocery list of the ingredients they need to get. Additionally, we will also implements a page where the user can keep track of current ongoing sales. Primarly, we are thinking of achieveing this by scrapping weekly flyers, based on the users favorite grocery stores. If better solutions present themselves, we will explore them and contrast with the current implementation on simplicity, functionaly and reliability.

### PLANNING YOUR WEEK

Lastly, the app will feature a meal planner. Here, the user will be able to create weekly menus. They will have the choice to add recipes they already have stored, or add different ones to the planner. If the recipes does not exist, they will pe prompted on wether or not they want to save it. An added benefit for the weekly planner will be that the user will be able to keep track of their calorie consumption. This is given that they follow their plan.
